As a DevOps Engineer,  I specialize in designing and implementing tooling to support application lifecyles.  
My background in systems engineering and operations enables me to efficiently work within real world constrainsts to deliver workflows and tools for building and delivering applications.
I have spent several years on a software engineering team to broaden my understanding of how the application fits in the overall system.
I am passionate about OSS and enjoy giving back to the OSS Community.
